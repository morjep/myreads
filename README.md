# MyReads Project

This is the the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The project was started from a static Udacity template and then made dynamic using React.

The app is a bookshelf where you can add books and change shelves depending on the state of the book.

## To use the app

To get started:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Important

The backend that serves the books in the App uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/cra-template/template/README.md).
